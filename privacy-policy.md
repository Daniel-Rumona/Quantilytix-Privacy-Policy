Best Practices for Privacy and Data Security in the App
Transparency: Keep users informed about what data is collected and why. This includes explaining AI-driven data usage for predictions and chatbot interactions.

Data Minimization: Collect only the data necessary for app functionality. Avoid requesting unnecessary permissions (e.g., location data if itâ€™s not required for core features).

Secure Storage and Transmission: Encrypt sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, and follow industry standards for secure data storage.

Access Controls: Limit access to user data within your team and restrict access based on role.

User Control: Allow users to access, update, and delete their data easily through app settings or account management options.

Consent for AI Features: Clearly explain AI features (such as predictions and chatbot) and obtain explicit user consent for data usage in these features.

Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security reviews to detect vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

Timely Updates for Policy Changes: Notify users in advance about any significant changes in data usage, retention policies, or new AI features that involve additional data processing.
